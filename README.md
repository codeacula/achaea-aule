# achaea-aule
The Aule system for Achaea. A refactored version of Harmony, to better support the community.

## Directions

Pray to whatever god you worship, because I'm not keen on supporting this much. Hopefully you know how to read aliases 
and stuff in Mudlet. In theory you should be able to send `aule` to see all the available commands, events, etc, but 
that relies on me making sure I document them in the code, and I'm not trustworthy.
